FS1: 
Featureset containing all information

No clusters at low epsilon
Increased nr of tfidf features produces fewer clusters and worsens homogeneity score, however it increases silhouette score.

Best performance
H: eps = 2.5, tfidf = 500
S: eps = 2, tfidf = 5000

FS2:
Featureset containing nearly all information

Mostly same as above. Silhouette score is not significantly increased by increasing tfidf.

Best performance
H: eps = 2.5, tfidf = 500
S: eps = 2, tfidf = 5000

FS3:
Featureset containing url information and origin

This featureset performs well at low epsilon and is completely destroyed at high epsilon for both evaluation metrics.
Increased tfidf significantly worsens performance of homogeneity score while only increasing silhouette score minimally.

Best performance
H: eps = 0.5, tfidf = 500
S: eps = 0.5, tfidf = 5000

FS4:
Featureset containing subject, body and body lsa

Increasing epsilon significantly increases homogeneity score until a cutoff between 1.5-2 where it drops. Silhouette score performs best at low epsilon

Best performance
H: eps = 1.5, tfidf = 5000
S: eps = 0.5, tfidf = 1000

FS5:
Featureset containing subject, body, body lsa, sender, receiver and url features

Increasing epsilon significantly increases homogeneity until after 2 where it drops

Best performance
H: eps = 2.0, tfidf = 1000
S: eps = 0.5, tfidf = 1000
